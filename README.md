Before performing analysis, check for duplicates and in case of null values, utilize forward/backward fill.
Questions:

    What is the total sales revenue for each category of menu items?
    How many orders are placed each day?
    Which menu item is the most frequently ordered?
    What is the total revenue generated by menu items?
    How does the revenue of each category compare over months?
    What is the average number of items per order?
    How do order volumes vary by time of day?
    How do sales trends differ across weekdays and weekends?
    How does the sales performance vary by category over different months?
    Compare the sales of top 5 menu items.

Data Cleaning:

    Removed duplicate records.
    Handled missing values using forward and backward fill methods to maintain data consistency.
    Corrected data types for all columns, especially date and time formats, aligning with the English US locale.

Data Transformation:

    Created new columns such as Exact Hours, Meal of the Day, and Time of Day based on order time.
    Merged menu item prices with order details using common keys like item_id and menu_item_id.
    Added features like Day Name, Month Name, Day of Week, and flagged orders as Weekend or Weekday.

Data Analysis & Dashboard:

Using Power Pivot in Excel, relationships between tables were established, and the data model was used to create pivot tables and measures. This led to the development of a dynamic dashboard that provides visual insights into McDonald’s sales performance.
Key Insights:

    Sales by Time of Day: Peak sales occur during lunch (12 PM - 2 PM) and dinner (6 PM - 8 PM).
    Top 5 Menu Items: The Meatball Marinara is the top-selling item, generating the highest revenue.
    Revenue by Category: The Burger category contributes the most to total revenue, followed by Chicken and Fries.
    Sales Trends: Weekend sales are higher, with Saturday showing the highest sales volume.
    Order and Revenue Correlation: Higher order volumes correspond with higher revenue generation.

Key Questions Answered:

    What is the total sales revenue for each category of menu items?
    How many orders are placed each day?
    Which menu item is the most frequently ordered?
    How does the revenue compare over months for each category?

    How does sales performance differ across weekdays and weekends?
    What are the sales and revenue trends for the top 5 menu items?
